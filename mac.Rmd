**Note:** Clicking the links below will take you directly to the download file, which means a pkg will start downloading. I've done this to help ease any confusion about which items to download.

## Step 1: Download & Install R

  * [Download link For Mac OS X](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/R-3.4.3.pkg)

## Step 2: Download & Install RStudio

  * [Download link For Mac OS X 10.6+](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.423.dmg)

## Step 3: Download & Install XQuartz

  * [Download link for XQuartz](https://dl.bintray.com/xquartz/downloads/XQuartz-2.7.11.dmg)

## Step 4: Download & Install Latex for Mac (MacTex) {.tabset}

  * [Download link for MacTex](http://tug.org/cgi-bin/mactex-download/MacTeX.pkg)

### Instructions

After downloading, move the file MacTeX.pkg to the desktop or another convenient spot, and double click it to install. Follow the straightforward instructions. Installation on a recent Macintosh takes four to six minutes.

### Troubleshooting

At the end of installation, the installer will report "Success." But sometimes, the installer puts up a dialog saying "Verifying..." and then the install hangs. In all cases known to us, rebooting the Macintosh fixes this problem. After the reboot, install again. 

## Step 5: Install `rmarkdown` with RStudio {.tabset}

###Instructions 

* Open RStudio from your applications folder.
* Then, copy & paste this code into the console: 
```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```
* If the console prompts you to install dependencies, type "y" and hit enter.

### Console Example
