**Note:** Clicking the links below will take you directly to the download file, which means a pkg will start downloading. I've done this to help ease any confusion about which items to download.

## Step 1: Download R, Version 3.4.3

  * [Download link For Other Platforms](https://cran.rstudio.com)

## Step 2: Download RStudio, Version 1.1.423

  * [Download link For Other Platforms](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

## Step 3: Open RStudio & Install `rmarkdown` & `tinytex` 

* Open RStudio from you applications folder.
* Then, copy & paste this code into the console: ```install.packages("devtools")```
* Next, copy and paste this code into the console: ```devtools::install_github(c('yihui/tinytex', 'rstudio/rmarkdown'))
tinytex::install_tinytex()```
  - If the console prompts you to install dependencies, type "y" and hit enter.
