Hey Everyone,

In order to make this workshop run smoothly, I'm asking everyone to make sure they have these installed on the computers they intend to use for the workshop. In case you're wondering, all of this is free so you won't need to worry about paying anything. If you open this PDF on the computer you intend to use for the workshop, I've hyperlinked the download links in the text below so it's easier for you to get what you need. If you have any problems, let me know and I'll do my best to help before March 9th. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
