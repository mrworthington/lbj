# Do Now: Inefficient Work

## Prompt:
* As you come in, grab coffee, some pastries, and find a partner. When you find one, each take no more than three minutes to share an example of a time where you or someone you knew had to accomplish a herculean task *&lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt;* you/they:

	* &lt;u&gt;Had the wrong tools&lt;/u&gt;, which made accomplishing that task completely inefficient, arduous, and more painful than you could have ever imagined. And, to this day, you sometimes have night terrors about that experience.
	
	* &lt;u&gt;Had the right tools&lt;/u&gt; to do that work, which made the work efficient, reasonable, and less burdensome—maybe even enjoyable—than it could have without those tools.

This is data from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), which captures something OPM calls the Inclusion Quotient, to get a sense about how these groups feel about their work environment. OPM says numbers should be improving over time, but they are not.

--

* Was San Antonio's largest employer in 1969, and one of the country's largest military installations for most of the 20th century.

--

* By December 1968, 126 formal complaints had been registered at Kelly and six studies were published analyzing patterns of racial discrimination documented between 1917-1966.

--

* Mexican civil service employees seeking higher grade promotions were equal to white peers on academic aptitude exams and leadership appraisal assessments, but were disporportionately rejected for grade level promotions compared to white peers on base.

--

* According to a 1969 Report produced by the Department of Defense, Mexican civil service employees and other minorities employed at Kelly expressed wide-spread distrust with the government's equal employment opportunity office, whom they said lacked the integrity to actually follow through on commitments they wanted to make.

# Questions

**1.** Does the government's current diversity inclusion intiative--which provides preferential treatment in hiring decisions--do enough to reverse past patterns of discrimination among civil service employees, considering the vast amount of wages that were lost because of the government's past action. 

**2.** What obligation, if any, should the government have to promote equity in scenarios where civil service employees---who spent their whole careers in civil service---were routinely turned down for jobs they were qualified for at disportionately high rates, leaving them with substantial lack of wealth?

**3.** What are other ways the government could improve its effectiveness of achieving it's two social goals: redressing past patterns of discrimination and making the government more representative of the people it serves?
